### Axel Greavette

I'm just a 18 y/o from Canada with a penchant for making things. 

I used to program *a lot*, but I kind of lost the groove over the course of the pandemic, and earlier this year I wiped my contributions. I'm trying to regain that curiousity and passion for code, but so far have only had midling success. 

Some other random facts:
- ðŸŒ± Robotics is ongoing. Check out our code [here](https://github.com/Gryphtech-Robotics/FRC-2023).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me where I'm thinking about going to school.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
