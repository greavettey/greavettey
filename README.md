### Axel Greavette

I'm just a 17 y/o from Canada with a penchant for making things. 

I used to program *a lot*, but I kind of lost the groove over the course of the pandemic, and earlier this year I wiped my contributions. I'm trying to regain that curiousity and passion for code, but so far have only had midling success. 

In the meantime I've been focusing on university applications, figuring out my career, and doing things I love with the people I love.

Some other random facts:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing a rewrite of my website (again).
- ðŸŒ± Robotics is rapidly approaching...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me where I'm thinking about going to school.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ I really like Lil Wayne, Pusha T, and BROCKHAMPTON.
