### Axel Greavette

Just a 17 y/o from Canada with a penchant for making things. 

I used to program *a lot*, but I kind of lost the groove over the course of the pandemic, and earlier this year I wiped my contributions. I'm trying to regain that curiousity and passion for code, but so far have only had midling success. 

In the meantime I've been focusing on high school, figuring out my career path, and doing things I love with the people I love.

Some other random facts:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing a complete rewrite of my mobile app, [Payment Tracker](https://pt.axel.gg).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m trying to find reasons to program.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what I've been listening too.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ I really like Lil Wayne.
